        </h1> 
    <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. <br> 
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide 
        <br>programmatic control over them.
        <br>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
        <br>and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended 
        <br>for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                <br> For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events <br> such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.<br> For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of <br> information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <section id="what_you_know" class="main-section"><h1>What you should already know</h1> <p>
            This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
            <ul>
<li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the 
<br>main page about JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

        </p></section>
        <section id="js_and_java" class="main-section"><h1>JavaScript and Java
        </h1><p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others
            <br>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's
            static typing and strong type checking.<br> JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs <br> which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
<br><br> In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on <br>a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model <br>instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is,<br> what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions <br> without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
<br><br> JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.<br> You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.<br> Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.        
</p></section>
        <section id="hello_world" class="main-section"><h1>Hello world</h1><p>
            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your <br>first "Hello world" JavaScript code: <br>
<strong>greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br>
greetMe("World");</strong>
<br>
     Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

        </p></section>
        <section id="variables" class="main-section"><h1>Variables</h1><p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.<br> The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        <br> <br>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), <br>or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, <br>letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        <br>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape <br>sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p></section>
        <section id="Declaring_var" class="main-section"><h1>Declaring variables</h1><p>
            You can declare a variable in three ways: <br>
            With the keyword var. For example, <br>
            var x = 42. <br>
            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br>
        
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,<br>
            x = 42.<br>
            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. <br>You shouldn't use this variant.
            With the keyword let. For example,<br>
            let y = 13.<br>
            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.<br>

            

        </p></section>
        <section id="Variable_scope" class="main-section"><h1>Variable scope</h1>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, <br> because it is available to any other code in the current document.When you declare a variable within<br> a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
            <br><br>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, 
            a variable declared within, <br>a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.
            <br> For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) 
            <br>within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 <br>
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.<br>
            if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not Defined
            
        </p></section>
        <section id="Global_var" class="main-section"><h1>Global variables</h1><p> 
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, 
            <br>so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
            <br>
            <br>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by <br> specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,<br> you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

        </p></section>
        <section id="Constants" class="main-section"><h1>Constants
        </h1><p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as <br>for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        <br>
        const PI = 3.14;
        <br>
        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.<br>
        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier <br>is assumed to represent a variable.
<br> You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:<br>
in the same scope. For example:<br>
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL<br>
CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements<br>
}
However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.<br>
const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";<br>


        </p></section>
        <section id="Data_types" class="main-section"><h1>Data types</h1><p>
            The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
<br>
<ul>
     <h3>Six data types that are primitives:</h3>

        <li>Boolean. true and false.
        </li>
        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, <br>null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
        </li>
        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
<h3>and Object</h3>
</ul> Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. <br>
Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.
<br> You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
</p>
        </p></section>
        <section id="if_else" class="main-section"><h1>if...else statement</h1>
        <p>
            Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional <br>else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
<br> if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; } <br><br>
condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. <br>
If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. <br>statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
<br>
You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:<br><br>
if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2; } <br> else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }<br>
<br> 
In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. <br>
To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice <br>
to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
<br>
<br>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br>
    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else { <br>
    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false; <br>
    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; } <br>
    <br>
    It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, <br>
    because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:<br>
    if (x = y) { /* statements here */ } <br>
    If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. <br>
    For example: <br> <br>
    if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
<br>
</p>
 </section>
        <section id="While_state" class="main-section"><h1>While statement
        </h1>
    <p>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:<br>
        <br>
        while (condition) statement <br> <br>
        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.<br> <br>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the <br>
        condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.<br>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.<br>
        Example: <br>
The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three: <br>
var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; } <br> <br>
With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:<br>
<ul>
    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
</ul>
After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.


    </p></section>
        <section id="Function_dec" class="main-section"><h1>Function declarations
        </h1><p>
            A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) 
            <br>consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.
                </li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
                </li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named square: <br>
            function square(number) { return number * number; } <br> <br>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. 
            The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of <br>the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself.
             The return statement specifies the value returned by the function. <br>
             <br> return number * number; <br> <br>
             Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the 
             <br>function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected 
             <br>globally or in the calling function.
